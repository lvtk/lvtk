            Request from run() that the host call the worker.

            This function is in the audio threading class.  It should be called from
            run() to request that the host call the work() method in a non-realtime
            context with the given arguments.

            This function is always safe to call from run(), but it is not
            guaranteed that the worker is actually called from a different thread.
            In particular, when free-wheeling (e.g. for offline rendering), the
            worker may be executed immediately.  This allows single-threaded
            processing with sample accuracy and avoids timing problems when run() is
            executing much faster or slower than real-time.

            Plugins SHOULD be written in such a way that if the worker runs
            immediately, and responses from the worker are delivered immediately,
            the effect of the work takes place immediately with sample accuracy.

            The @p data MUST be safe for the host to copy and later pass to work(),
            and the host MUST guarantee that it will be eventually passed to work()
            if this function returns WORKER_SUCCESS.

            @param size   The size of @p data.
            @param data   Message to pass to work(), or NULL.
